<title>1996 Conference Corporate Invitation</title>
<body bgcolor="#eeeed4">
To whom it may concern,
<p>
<dd>	On November 3-4, 1995 the student chapter of the Association for 
Computing Machinery at the University of Illinois held the first annual 
Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference.  The conference was a resounding 
success, thanks to the support of student, faculty, corporate contacts 
and our keynote speaker, Steve Wozniak.  In addition to the variety of 
talks and the programming contest given at the conference, we held a 
computing employment fair, attended by eleven corporations and around 
150 student members from across the midwest.
<p>
<dd>	This year, we are planning to hold the second annual conference on 
October 11-13, 1996.  At the suggestion of the companies involved last 
year, we have decided to make the computing employment fair a whole-day 
event on Friday, October 11. The employment fair is targeted at careers 
in computing-related fields, to be attended by both University of 
Illinois students at large and conference participants from throughout 
the midwest.
<p>
<dd>	One reason we have opted to expand the employment fair so vastly is  
that the Engineering Expo recruiting fair has been scheduled for the 
third day of classes for the Fall semester, which is too early for most
students to prepare resumeés.  We need your help to fund the conference 
and keep student admission costs low.  We ask that corporations 
attending the employment fair donate $200 to help cover the costs of the 
fair and the conference; corporations donating in excess of $500 will 
become "Official Conference Sponsors", receiving top billing on 
ACM@UIUC's web server, which receives over 80,000 hits per day and 
optimal placement in the employment fair.  All participating companies 
will have full access to conference events.
<p>
<dd>	Enclosed is a registration form for the Employment Fair.  You can also 
register online at http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/events/conference/corpreg.html
If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me via email at

Sincerely,
<p>

ACM@UIUC 1996/97 Chair
