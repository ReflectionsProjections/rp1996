To whom it may concern,
<p>
<dd>	On November 3-4, 1995 the student chapter of the Association for 
Computing Machinery at the University of Illinois held the first annual 
Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference.  The conference was a resounding 
success, thanks to the support of students, and our keynote speaker,
Steve Wozniak.  We especially couldn't have done it without 
COMPANY_NAME's support.  I would like to once again extend ACM@UIUC's
gratitude to you and take the opportunity to announce the second annual
conference.  We have done our best to take your suggestions from the 1995
event into account in the planning of Reflections | Projections 1996.
<p>	
<dd>	This year, we are planning to hold the second annual conference on 
October 11-13, 1996.  At the suggestion of your company and the 
other companies involved last year, we have decided to make the 
computing employment fair a whole-day event on Friday, October 11. The 
employment fair is again targeted at careers in computing-related 
fields, to be attended by both University of Illinois students at large 
and conference participants from throughout the Midwest.  One reason we 
have opted to expand the employment fair so vastly is that the 
Engineering Expo recruiting fair has been scheduled for the third day of 
classes for the Fall semester, which is too early for most students to 
prepare resumesé. By opening the recruiting fair to all University of
Illinois students, we are hoping to greatly increase student participation
in the event.
<p>
<dd>	In addition to opening the employment fair to all UIUC students, 
we plan to increase overall conference participation by cutting student
admission costs as much as possible.  For this reason, we are again asking
for you help to fund the conference.  We ask that corporations attending 
the employment fair donate $200 to help cover the costs of the fair and 
the conference;  corporations donating in excess of $500 will become 
"Official Conference Sponsors", receiving top billing on ACM@UIUC's web 
server, which receives over 80,000 hits per day and optimal placement in 
the employment fair.  All participating companies will have full access 
to conference events.	
<p>
<dd>	Enclosed is a registration form for the Employment Fair.  You can also 
register online at http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/corpreg.html
If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me via email at 
reflections@acm.uiuc.edu or by voice at (217)333-5828.

Sincerely,
<p>

ACM@UIUC 1996/97 Chair
