<H2>Why Should I Attend?</H2>
The Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference was conceived to bring 
students and professionals together to provide timely,
accurate and interesting information about computer technologies.  
Attendees get the chance to interact with computer gurus of the 
past and those on the cutting edge of computers and technology.  
During the 1995 Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference, attendees
were entertained by keynote speaker Steve Wozniak's anecdotes
about the early days of personal computers.  In addition to
Woz's entertaining speech, conference goers were able to
learn about TCP/IP network programming, the future of
object-oriented programming from Ralph Johnson, and some 
spent time attempting to stomp others in "Mech Mania: It's
Stompin' Time", the Conference '95 programming contest.


<p>

This year's conference again provides ample opportunity for attendees
to learn and have fun.  Whether you are interested in tomorrow's 
languages, want to talk to one of our corporate sponsors about 
employment, or want to conquer the world and win prizes with 
your programming  prowess, this year's conference is for you.  
ACM@UIUC has tried to expand Conference '96 in every direction 
by attracting informative speakers, bleeding edge technologies 
companies, and providing social events for attendees.  We 
have taken every suggestion for improvement from 
Conference '95 and made the Midwestern ACM Chapter 
Conference an event not to be missed.

<P>

<H2>Ok, ok... When is it?  Oh yeah, and where again?</h2>
This year, conference events will be held from Friday October 11, 1996 
through Sunday October 13, 1996.  The Employment Fair will be an
all-day affair on Friday October 11, and the programming contest will
run through the weekend.  Conference talks, including the keynotes, will
occur on Saturday October 12, 1996. 

<P>

All of the conference events will take place on the campus of the University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.  The twin cities are located in central 
Illinois, approximately 150 miles south of Chicago, Illinois.  Although
ACM@UIUC does not currently have hotel rooms reserved for the conference,
we believe Urbana-Champaign has enough hotel capacity.  If you have
questions about hotel or area information, please mail 
reflections@acm.uiuc.edu.
